# diabetes-app
## Overview
This project is about helping people with diabetes track their blood sugar levels/meals and connect with other affected by
the disease. The goal of this project is to allow users to trace their day by day entries and inform them about the disease
so they can better understand how to live with it. 

This project will have a great impact directly to my family and I, since my spouse was diagnosed with gestational diabetes
and is currently in her third trimester of pregnancy. My objective is to help my spouse change eating habits by observing
her logs and accordingly alternate her dietary choices. In addition, I would like to expand this application into a safe
network for affected people by the disease to communicate and understand more about it.
